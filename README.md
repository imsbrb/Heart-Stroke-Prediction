 Heart strokes are among the leading causes of mortality globally, responsible for one death every
 minute. With modern healthcare facing the challenge of processing vast amounts of data, machine learning
 (ML) provides an effective means to automate and improve early prediction. This study uses three machine
 learning algorithms—Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—to predict
 heart stroke risk based on patient health data.
 
 The dataset includes demographic, health, and lifestyle features and was subjected to extensive
 preprocessing, including outlier removal and feature encoding. Each model's performance was evaluated
 on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results showed that the Random Forest algorithm
 performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 95% and an F1-score of 0.96. This study highlights the
 potential of ML in automating heart stroke prediction, providing tools for early detection and improved
 patient care.
